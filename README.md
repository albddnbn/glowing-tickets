# Ticket Response Storage:
A simple GUI-based program written in Python and initially with guizero which will allow user (technician) to create their own set of canned responses.

This program is written using the guizero Python library, but I have plans to attempt to make the GUI look better along with doing a semi-transparent overlay.

I am considering tkinter and wxpython as the library to use for the GUI in the upgrade.
