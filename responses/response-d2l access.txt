d2l access

Hi $ticketowner,

This is Alex from DTCC Tech Support. After you log in to my.dtcc.edu, and click on 'My Courses / D2L', Microsoft will prompt you for credentials. 

Please enter your Delaware tech email address and password when this happens, and you should be able to proceed to D2L and access your course content.

Please let me know if you are not able to access D2L after entering your Delaware Tech credentials when prompted.

Thank you for your time.
